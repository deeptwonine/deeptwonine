- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my projects, or in other words, I would love it if someone would take the time to review my bad code and point out mistakes, especially in [apod-viewer-legacy](https://www.github.com/dd1929/apod-viewer-legacy).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: deepto.debnath@outlook.com for more friendly purposes (or spamming tendencies), and dd1929@protonmail.com for serious work.
